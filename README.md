# An Automated Spotify Playlist from YouTube Liked Videos
This project uses a Python script in order to take Liked videos from my YouTube account, and automatically add them to a dedicated Playlist in my Spotify Account. !<img width="1000" alt="youtube videos to spotify picture" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62456147/87292535-88f54200-c533-11ea-9fef-ca3502093451.png">
